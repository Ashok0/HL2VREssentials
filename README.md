# Half-Life 2 VR Essentials Modpack (v0.9)
Last updated: September 16, 2022 

## Preamble
Half-Life 2 has gained a massive library of incredible mods over the years.  Keeping track of the best HL2 mods can be cumbersome as everything is mostly scattered across Gamebanana, Moddb, and Gmod Workshop.  There are also no great all-one-one HL2 texture mods for retexturing the entire game, as most texture mods are either not comprehensive or make contentious changes to the game's original artstyle.  

I have made an attempt to greatly simplify the Half-Life 2 VR's modding process by creating a standalone copy of Mod Organizer 2 which is preconfigured with the most essential mods for improving Half-Life 2 VR's visuals.  Great care was taken in selecting the best and most "VR friendly" models and textures across a wide variety of different texture mods.  

This modpack is also pre-configured with experimental VR support for Minerva Metastasis, Research and Development, and Nightmare House Remake.  According to Nixel on Gmod Workshop, these campaigns can be completed without their DLL files.  I have not fully tested these campaigns, but they should theoretically work in VR. 

## Installation
1. Download HLVR_MO2_Repack.rar and extract Mod Organizer 2 to a folder of your choice.
2. Download EP1+2 Assets.rar and extract the contents to your \Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life 2 VR\ folder.
3. Navigate to where you extracted HLVR_MO2_Repack.rar and run ModOrganizer.exe
4. Select "Run" in the upper right corner of Mod Organizer 2 to launch Half-Life 2 VR with mods.

Included Campaigns
Nightmare House 1 Remake
MINERVA
Research and Development

## Other Recommended Mods
- zDak Texture Pack.  A very nice and comprehensive texture mod which looks beautiful in VR.  Not included in this modpack due to its art style changes.

## Compatability notes
- Black Mesa Source:  Does not work.  Maps work in VR but NPCs do not load.
- Black Mesa: Does not work.  Crashes to the desktop.
- Cinematic Mod 2013: Does not work.  Reflections are glitched which renders the mod mostly unusable.  CM2013 oddly worked fine with the Half-Life 2 VR private beta.  One of the final September updates seems to have broken the mod.
