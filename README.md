# Half-Life 2 VR Essentials Modpack (v0.9)
Last updated: September 16, 2022 

## Preamble
Half-Life 2 has gained a massive library of incredible mods over the years.  Keeping track of the best HL2 mods can be cumbersome as everything is mostly scattered across Gamebanana, Moddb, and Gmod Workshop.  There are arguably no great all-one-one HL2 texture mods for retexturing the entire game, as most texture mods are either not comprehensive or make contentious changes to the game's original artstyle.  

I have made an attempt to greatly simplify the Half-Life 2 VR's modding process by creating a standalone copy of Mod Organizer 2 which is preconfigured with the most essential mods for improving immersion in Half-Life 2 VR.  Great care was taken in selecting the best and most "VR friendly" models and textures with an appropriate load order across a wide variety of different texture mods.  All credit for the mods included in this modpack goes to the original mod authors.   

This modpack is also pre-configured with experimental VR support for Minerva Metastasis, Research and Development, and Nightmare House Remake.  According to Nixel on Gmod Workshop, these campaigns can be completed without their DLL files.  I have not fully tested these campaigns, but they should theoretically work in VR. 

## Installation
1. Download [**HLVR_MO2_Repack.rar**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VYIpXoqdFKrUVWgkBeqd89UNi3zkch4q/view?usp=sharing) and extract Mod Organizer 2 to a folder of your choice.
2. Download [**EP1+2 Assets.rar**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g_QkR3Q35AnTKcdPfPNMNj5helwAIz2w/view?usp=sharing) and extract the contents to your \Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life 2 VR\ folder.  (This adds episodic assets to your HL2VR folder.  This will NOT allow you to play the episodes, but it will allow you to play Minerva, Research and Development, and Nightmare House Remake which all use Episode 1+2 models and textures.)
3. Navigate to where you extracted HLVR_MO2_Repack.rar and run ModOrganizer.exe
4. Select "Run" in the upper right corner of Mod Organizer 2 to launch Half-Life 2 VR with the mods included in this modpack.

# Voice Attack Setup (Optional)
Half-Life 2 VR has a default walk speed which some people may find unnaturally fast.  This modpack binds two seperate walking speeds to the "alt" (slow walking) and "shift" (running) keys.  If you bind words like "walk" and "run" to the "alt" and "shift" keys in the free version of Voice Attack, you can toggle between walking and running on the fly in VR by simply reciting "walk" or "run" in your headset mic!

## Other Recommended Mods
- []():
- [**zDak Total Textures Pack**](https://www.moddb.com/addons/zdak-total-textures-pack-v13):  A very nice and comprehensive texture mod which looks beautiful in VR.  Not included in this modpack due to its art style changes.

## Recommended Modding Tools
- [**Mod Organizer 2 Plugin for Half-Life 2 VR**](https://www.nexusmods.com/halflife2/mods/35):  Allows for Skyrim style modding with Mod Organizer 2.  Removes the complexity of dealing with "custom" folders.
- [**GCFScape**](https://nemstools.github.io/pages/GCFScape-Download.html): Used for decompressing VPK files.
- [**Gmad - Easy Addon Extractor**](https://www.moddb.com/mods/garrys-mod/downloads/gmad-easy-addon-extractor): Used for decompressing Garry's Mod addons.

## Compatability notes
- Black Mesa Source:  Does not work.  Maps work in VR but NPCs do not load.
- Black Mesa: Does not work.  Crashes to the desktop.
- Cinematic Mod 2013: Does not work.  Reflections are glitched which renders the mod mostly unusable.  CM2013 oddly worked fine with the Half-Life 2 VR private beta.  One of the final September updates seems to have broken the mod.
